Chronos 60% Keyboard PCB

A simple MX/Alps 60% board that just works.

 * ANSI/ISO with arrow keys layout main
 * Regular ANSI/ISO layout secondary
 * AEK-II Alps layout tertiary
 
The main layout takes precedence over all other layouts. 
Some keys for the other layouts may be flipped around.
 
 * ANSI/ISO enter/shift, split/unified backspace
 * Optional LED backlighting
 * Optional RGB underglow
 * Recommended layout firmware available for a quick "build and use" solution
 * Follows good practices for circuitry design for a stable, reliable result
